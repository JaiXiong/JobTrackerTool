# COPILOT EDITS OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES
                
## PRIME DIRECTIVE
	Avoid working on more than one file at a time.
	Multiple simultaneous edits to a file will cause corruption.
	Be chatting and teach about what you are doing while coding.

## LARGE FILE & COMPLEX CHANGE PROTOCOL

### MANDATORY PLANNING PHASE
    Always reference the codebase, no hallucinations or assumptions.
    Always reference our chat history for context.

	When working with large files (>300 lines) or complex changes:
		1. ALWAYS start by creating a detailed plan BEFORE making any edits
            2. Your plan MUST include:
                   - All functions/sections that need modification
                   - The order in which changes should be applied
                   - Dependencies between changes
                   - Estimated number of separate edits required
                
            3. Format your plan as:
## PROPOSED EDIT PLAN
	Working with: [filename]
	Total planned edits: [number]

### MAKING EDITS
	- Focus on one conceptual change at a time
	- Show clear "before" and "after" snippets when proposing changes
	- Include concise explanations of what changed and why
	- Always check if the edit maintains the project's coding style

### Edit sequence:
	1. [First specific change] - Purpose: [why]
	2. [Second specific change] - Purpose: [why]
	3. Do you approve this plan? I'll proceed with Edit [number] after your confirmation.
	4. WAIT for explicit user confirmation before making ANY edits when user ok edit [number]
            
### EXECUTION PHASE
	- After each individual edit, clearly indicate progress:
		"âœ… Completed edit [#] of [total]. Ready for next edit?"
	- If you discover additional needed changes during editing:
	- STOP and update the plan
	- Get approval before continuing
                
### REFACTORING GUIDANCE
	When refactoring large files:
	- Break work into logical, independently functional chunks
	- Ensure each intermediate state maintains functionality
	- Consider temporary duplication as a valid interim step
	- Always indicate the refactoring pattern being applied
                
### RATE LIMIT AVOIDANCE
	- For very large files, suggest splitting changes across multiple sessions
	- Prioritize changes that are logically complete units
	- Always provide clear stopping points
            
## General Requirements
	Use modern technologies as described below for all code suggestions. Prioritize clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments.
            
### Accessibility
	
        
## Browser Compatibility
	- Prioritize feature detection (`if ('fetch' in window)` etc.).
        - Support latest two stable releases of major browsers:
	- Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari (macOS/iOS)
        - Emphasize progressive enhancement with polyfills or bundlers (e.g., **Babel**, **Vite**) as needed.
            
## HTML/CSS Requirements
	- **HTML**:
	- Use HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<search>`, etc.)
	- Include appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
	- Ensure valid markup that passes W3C validation
	- Use responsive design practices
	- Optimize images using modern formats (`WebP`, `AVIF`)
	- Include `loading="lazy"` on images where applicable
	- Generate `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for responsive images when relevant
	- Prioritize SEO-friendly elements (`<title>`, `<meta description>`, Open Graph tags)
            
	- **CSS**:
	- Use modern CSS features including:
	- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
	- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
	- CSS animations and transitions
	- Media queries for responsive design
	- Logical properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-block`, etc.)
	- Modern selectors (`:is()`, `:where()`, `:has()`)
	- Follow BEM or similar methodology for class naming
	- Use CSS nesting where appropriate
	- Include dark mode support with `prefers-color-scheme`
	- Prioritize modern, performant fonts and variable fonts for smaller file sizes
	- Use modern units (`rem`, `vh`, `vw`) instead of traditional pixels (`px`) for better responsiveness
    
## Security Considerations
	- Sanitize all user inputs thoroughly.
	- Parameterize database queries.
	- Enforce strong Content Security Policies (CSP).
	- Use CSRF protection where applicable.
	- Ensure secure cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`).
	- Limit privileges and enforce role-based access control.
	- Implement detailed internal logging and monitoring.
